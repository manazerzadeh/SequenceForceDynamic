Three days of training. Day1: Blocks 1-26 
Day2: Blocks 27-46
Day3: Blocks 47-66
Test Day3: Blocks 67-70

Each block consists of 24 trials. Every 5 trial, the cue is announced and then five execution of the cued sequence follows 
So 4 of these bouts are present in each block 

Block 1 and 2: task training on both hands, two sequences (not reapeated again later)

Block 3 - 6: pre test. two sequence types (extrinsically connected), and two sequence types for control (board changes every block)

Blocks 7-66: Training 

Blocks 67-70: post test. As block 3-6 


Sequence extrinsic relations : 1 <-> 5 , 2 <-> 6, 3 <-> 7, 4 <->8
